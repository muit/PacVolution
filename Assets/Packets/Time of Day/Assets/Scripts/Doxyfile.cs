\n \section start Getting Started

1. Add the sky dome to your scene:
 - Drag the prefab found in "Sky Assets/Prefabs" into your scene
 - If your scene uses fog, it is recommended to enable "World -> Set Fog Color" in the prefab inspector
 - If your scene uses ambient light, it is recommended to enable "World -> Set Ambient Light" in the prefab inspector
 - Tweak the other parameters until you are satisfied with the result

2. Move the sky dome to the camera position in every frame:
 - Select your camera and add the Time of Day camera script (Component -> Time of Day -> Camera Main Script)
 - Drag your instance of the sky dome onto the the "Sky" property of the script
 - Set "Dome Pos To Camera" to enabled if it is not already
 - Tag this camera game object as "MainCamera"

3. Automatically fit the sky dome size to the far clip plane:
 - Go to the Time of Day camera script of your camera
 - Set "Dome Scale To Far Clip" to enabled
 - Set "Dome Scale Factor" to a value suitable for your specific scene and platform

4. Render sun shafts on the main camera:
 - Select your camera and add the Time of Day sun shaft script (Component -> Time of Day -> Camera Sun Shafts)
 - Drag your instance of the sky dome onto the the "Sky" property of the script
 - Tweak the parameters until you are satisfied with the result

<strong>REMARK:</strong>
The camera script moves the sky dome directly before clipping the scene, guaranteeing that all other position updates have been processed. You should not move the sky dome in "LateUpdate" because this can cause minor differences in the sky dome position between frames when moving the camera.



\n \section cycle Day & Night Cycle

The sky dome prefab has a script TOD_Time attached to it that manages the dynamic day & night cycle. Enabling and disabling this script enables and disables the automatic cycle.

The following parameters are being set by the script:
- TOD_Sky.Cycle.Hour
- TOD_Sky.Cycle.Day
- TOD_Sky.Cycle.Month
- TOD_Sky.Cycle.Year
- TOD_Sky.Cycle.MoonPhase



\n \section weather Weather Manager

The script TOD_Weather can be used to automatically set various parameters of TOD_Sky according to weather presets.

The following parameters are being set by the script:
- TOD_Sky.Atmosphere.Fogginess
- TOD_Sky.Clouds.Density
- TOD_Sky.Clouds.Sharpness
- TOD_Sky.Clouds.Brightness



\n \section cycle Time & Location Setup

The TOD_Sky.Cycle parameter section allows for configuration of the sky dome to represent the exact sun movement and day length of any location on the planet depending on Gregorian date, UTC/GMT time zone and geographic coordinates. It is important to set the correct time zone with the longitude and latitude of the location to guarantee consistent results with the real world. All of those parameters are completely optional though - if the sky dome should be used in a generic fantasy world they can simply be ignored and left at their default values.



\n \section quality Quality Levels

There are various different quality levels for both the sky dome and the cloud shader. Those quality settings can be configured both dynamically at runtime and directly in the Unity editor window using two inspector enums.

TOD_Sky.CloudQuality:
- Bumped offers complex cloud shading with dynamic density and cloud normal mapping
- Density offers simplified cloud shading with dynamic density but without normal mapping
- Fastest offers extremely simplified cloud shading with simplified cloud shape calculations

TOD_Sky.MeshQuality:
- High sky dome and moon mesh vertex count
- Medium sky dome and moon mesh vertex count
- Low sky dome and moon mesh vertex count



\n \section performance Performance Remarks

- The size of a web player with just the sky dome is only around 200KB as most equations are evaluated dynamically
- All scripts and shaders are highly optimized and will not cause significant FPS drops on desktop computers
- Older mobile devices should switch to the cloud and dome quality settings that offer suitable performance
- The cloud shadows utilize a Unity projector and require another draw call for all objects they are projected on
- The sun shaft image effect is the only component that requires Unity Pro, everything else works just as well on Indie
- Reducing the texture resolution in the cloud texture import settings can increase performance on mobile



\n \section rendering Rendering Order

All components of the sky dome are being rendered after the opaque but before the transparent meshes of your scene.That means that only areas of the sky dome that are not being occluded by any other geometry have to be rendered.

The rendering order of the sky dome components is the following:
- Transparent-500 Unity Skybox (if your scene uses one)
- Transparent-490 Space Dome   (only at night)
- Transparent-480 Moon Mesh    (only at night and if visible)
- Transparent-470 Atmosphere   (if not manually disabled)
- Transparent-460 Sun Plane    (only at day and if visible)
- Transparent-450 Cloud Dome   (if not manually disabled)

This leads to 2-4 draw calls to render the complete sky dome.



\n \section shaders Global Shader Parameters

There are some global shader parameters set by the TOD_Sky script that can be used in your custom shaders.

Gamma values:
- TOD_Gamma        = TOD_Sky.Gamma
- TOD_OneOverGamma = TOD_Sky.OneOverGamma

Various colors:
- TOD_SunColor      = TOD_Sky.SunColor
- TOD_MoonColor     = TOD_Sky.MoonColor
- TOD_LightColor    = TOD_Sky.LightColor
- TOD_CloudColor    = TOD_Sky.CloudColor
- TOD_AdditiveColor = TOD_Sky.AdditiveColor
- TOD_MoonHaloColor = TOD_Sky.MoonHaloColor

World space direction vectors:
- TOD_SunDirection   = TOD_Sky.SunDirection
- TOD_MoonDirection  = TOD_Sky.MoonDirection
- TOD_LightDirection = TOD_Sky.LightDirection

Sky dome object space direction vectors:
- TOD_LocalSunDirection   = InverseTransformDirection(TOD_Sky.SunDirection)
- TOD_LocalMoonDirection  = InverseTransformDirection(TOD_Sky.MoonDirection)
- TOD_LocalLightDirection = InverseTransformDirection(TOD_Sky.LightDirection)

Those variables can be used in your custom shaders by simply defining uniform variables with the same name. Those will then automatically be filled with the correct values. The Time of Day shaders call pow(color, TOD_OneOverGamma) on the result colors of either vertex or fragment shaders to assure consistent visuals in both linear and gamma space.



\n \section presets Presets

There are several presets that can be applied by clicking the "Choose Preset" button in the TOD_Sky inspector.



\n \section examples Examples

The package comes with various example scripts to demonstrate sky dome interaction.

- AudioAtDay / AudioAtNight / AudioAtWeather:
  Fade audio sources in and out according to daytime or a specific weather type
- ParticleAtDay / ParticleAtNight / ParticleAtWeather:
  Fade particle systems in and out according to daytime or a specific weather type
- RenderAtDay / RenderAtNight / RenderAtWeather:
  Enable or disable renderer components according to daytime or a specific weather type
- DeviceTime:
  Automatically set the daytime to the device time on scene start



\n \section faq Frequently Asked Questions

Q: How can I use the sky dome with the virtual reality devices like the Oculus Rift?
- Add the TOD_Camera script to one of the cameras (preferably the one that's being rendered first)
- The sky will render correctly without duplicate images or artifacts

Q: How can I use custom skybox at night?
- Disable the child object called "Space"
- Setup your camera to render the skybox of your choice, it will automatically be visible at night

Q: How can I align the cardinal directions with those of the scene?
- Rotate the sky dome around the y-axis such that the sun rises in the east of your scene
- Do not set the scale to negative values as this will lead to rendering artifacts

Q: How can I use lightmapping?
- Disable the shadows of the sun and moon directional lights
- Add a dummy directional light to bake your lightmaps from

<strong>REMARK:</strong>
Lightmaps are not meant to be used with moving light sources as they always represent static lighting conditions. You should therefore always use a static dummy directional light to bake your lightmaps with.

Q: How can I synchronize cloud movement over multiple clients?
- Synchronize the property TOD_Sky.AnimationComponent.CloudUV of type Vector4
- Cloud movement and shape will be identical accross clients

Q: How can I fix Z-fighting and sorting issues with the cloud shadows?
- Adjust the values for "Offset" directly in the shader code of the cloud shadow shaders

<strong>REMARK:</strong>
Offset values have to be constants and can therefore only be adjusted directly in the shader code. Suitable values depend on the depth buffer resolution of the targeted platform and hardware. While the default values work in most scenarios, some scenes might require some further tweaking. If you are having issues with setting those values up correctly, please feel free to contact me.
